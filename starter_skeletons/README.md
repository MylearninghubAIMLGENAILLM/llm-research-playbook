# Starter Skeletons

Copy these into new projects to avoid boilerplate from scratch.

Suggested files to add (examples):
- `train.py` (argparse + config loading + logging)
- `models/` (Transformer blocks, adapters, heads)
- `data/` (streaming loaders, tokenization)
- `scripts/` (launch scripts, SLURM examples)
