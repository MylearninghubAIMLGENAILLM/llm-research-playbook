# Research Projects (Capstones)

Pick 1–2 directions and take them to paper quality:
- **Hallucination Mitigation**: RAG + preference optimization (DPO/RLHF)
- **Long-Context**: Efficient attention with position strategy comparison
- **Multimodal QA**: CLIP-like pretraining + instruction-tuned decoder
- **Alignment**: Compare PPO vs. DPO vs. Constitutional AI

## Paper Checklist
- Clear problem statement & related work
- Datasets & evaluation protocols
- Strong baselines, ablations, error analysis
- Compute budget and efficiency analysis
- Reproducibility: seeds, configs, scripts
